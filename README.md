# Calculator
A simple calculator app

This was my first effort at writing a working application. It started as a tutorial for learning autolayout,
and once I had the buttons all laid out I thought it would be a fun challenge to try to make the calculator work.
It gave me a lot of practice with control flow and thinking about when and how to convert between
Strings, Doubles and Ints. It also provided me with my first hands-on practice with debugging. I progressively added more
functionality, inevitably broke something, and had to go back and figure out where the discrepency was between what I
thought I had told the computer to do, and I what I had actually told the computer to do. There are a lot of things 
I would probably do differently now that I know more about MVC and more elegant syntax for optionals, but it mostly works!
